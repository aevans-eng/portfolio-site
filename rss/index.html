Developed a parametric MATLAB script using Bredt&#x2019;s Thin-Wall Formula to optimize geometry for stiffness-to-weight efficiency.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Result:</strong></b> A V2 design featuring an upsized 2.5&quot; crossbar and integrated angle-iron gussets that reduced tip deflection by 31% while maintaining a 2.7 FoS under a 4G pothole load.<br><br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></b><br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. Mathematical Root Cause Analysis</strong></b> Identified that torsional twist in the crossbar was the primary driver of failure, accounting for 94% of total vertical deflection at the receiver tip.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Methodology:</strong></b> Used image-based scaling in SolidWorks to determine the bike rack&#x2019;s Center of Gravity (COG) and resultant moment arm.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Modeling:</strong></b> Simplified the system into a cantilevered receiver and a non-circular shaft in torsion to maintain analytical efficiency.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. Geometric Optimization (The &quot;Bigger vs. Thicker&quot; Decision)</strong></b> Evaluated the governing equations for the Angle of Twist to determine the most weight-efficient stiffening method.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Finding:</strong></b> Midline Area (Am) has a squared relationship with stiffness in the numerator, whereas wall thickness (t) has a linear relationship.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Decision:</strong></b> Upsized from a 2.0&quot; to a 2.5&quot; profile (Option A), yielding a 52.6% theoretical stiffness gain compared to V1 while maintaining cost and packaging requirements.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">3. Multi-Stage Validation (MATLAB vs. FEA)</strong></b> Correlated hand calculations with SolidWorks Simulation to define the limits of elementary torsion theory.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Stage 1 (V1):</strong></b> Achieved an 8.9% variance between MATLAB and FEA, confirming the analytical model captured the primary physics.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Stage 2 (V2):</strong></b> Identified a 37% discrepancy caused by local wall distortion as the b/t ratio reached 10, highlighting where FEA is required to capture final geometric compliance.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4. Structural Integrity &amp; Reinforcement</strong></b> Used the &quot;Line Method&quot; (Norton) to analyze weld shear under dynamic 4G loads.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Finding:</strong></b> Analysis revealed a 0.95 Factor of Safety at the receiver-to-crossbar weld under a 720 lb (4G) load, indicating a likely failure at the upper tension face.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Fix:</strong></b> Evaluated reinforcement strategies and selected an Angle Iron gusset to act as a strain relief, successfully distributing the bending moment and ensuring structural safety.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">ENGINEERING RETROSPECTIVE</strong></b> This project demonstrates the value of First-Principles Thinking and a Bias for Action. The V1 prototype provided the empirical data necessary to anchor the V2 analysis, proving that iterative design, informed by engineering fundamentals, is the fastest path to functional results.</div></div><h3 id="part-1-the-scrappy-prototype"><strong>Part 1: The &quot;Scrappy&quot; Prototype</strong></h3><p><em>Context: To meet a strict deadline for a trip with friends, I had to act first.
