Although it was functional and lasted, whenever we hit a large bump, the bike rack would swing backwards.</p><p>To gain more insight into why my hitch was having issues, I first developed a parametric MATLAB script, then created an FEA simulation to validate the V2 design.</p><p><strong>The goal:</strong> minimize the swinging of the bike rack using a first principles analysis without over-complicating the design, and ensuring it won&apos;t snap going over a cross ditch.</p><p>Project summary (TLDR) in the box below:</p><hr><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">PROJECT SUMMARY: HIGH-CLEARANCE HITCH REDESIGN</strong></b><br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Design Goal: </strong></b>Redesign a trailer hitch to minimize angular deflection while maintaining a Factor of Safety of 2.0 under dynamic loading (4G bump scenario).<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Problem: </strong></b>Two summers ago I built a hitch on a tight budget, and timeline, for a mountain biking trip. It worked, but whenever we hit a large bump the bike rack would swing backwards. I wanted to understand the root cause and fix it properly.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Approach:</strong></b> I started with first principles to isolate which component was causing the deflection. Using the &quot;softest spring&quot; principle, I identified the crossbar as the primary issue, torsional twist accounted for 94% of the vertical deflection at the tip. I built a parametric MATLAB script using Bredt&apos;s Thin-Wall Formula to model the system (receiver as cantilever beam, crossbar as a non-circular shaft in torsion), then validated the final design with FEA and MATLAB.<br>For the geometric optimization, I analyzed the governing equation for angle of twist and found that the midline area has a squared relationship with stiffness while wall thickness is linear. Decision matrices showed that upsizing from 2.0&quot; to 2.5&quot; (Option A) gave a 52.6% theoretical stiffness gain without needing custom sizes or complicated fabrication. When I checked the weld stresses using Norton&apos;s &quot;weld as a line&quot; method, the receiver-to-crossbar weld showed a 0.95 FoS under 4G loading, theoretical failure. A weighted matrix showed adding an angle iron gusset would be the ideal design decision.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Result: </strong></b>The V2 design reduced tip deflection by 31% and maintained an average 2.7 FoS at critical nodes under the 4G loading scenario. MATLAB predictions matched FEA within 8.9% for V1, confirming the validity of the setup. The V2 geometry showed a larger 37% variance due to local wall distortion (b/t ratio increased from 8 to 10), which highlighted where Bredt&apos;s Formula breaks down and FEA becomes necessary.<br><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Key Takeaway: </strong></b>This project reinforced the &quot;fail fast, learn fast&quot; value for me. The V1 gave me real-world feedback and a baseline to improve from, proving that iterative design beats analysis paralysis.</div></div><hr><p>End of summary.</p><h3 id="part-1-the-scrappy-prototype"><strong>Part 1: The &quot;Scrappy&quot; Prototype</strong></h3><p>The project began with a $50 budget and a tight timeline.

<p>The variance in results can be attributed to more prominent local wall deformation in the V2 geometry due to an increased width to thickness ratio of 10 (V2) from 8 (V1). This is since Bredt&apos;s Formula assumes a rigid cross-section that does not deform in order to simplify calculations.</p><pre><code>==================================================
